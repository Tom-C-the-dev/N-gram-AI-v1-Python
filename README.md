# N-gram-AI-v1-Python
version 1 of my N-gram model in python. Mainly made to write a Shakespearean sonnet. Doesn't yet use any words for context or temperature. Basically an over glorified random words selection program. Is just a proof of concept.

for use change variable source to read the file that you want it to.
